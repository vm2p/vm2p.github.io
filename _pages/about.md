# Short Bio

I am an Advanced Computer Scientist at the Computer Science Laboratory ([CSL](https://www.csl.sri.com])) at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com). My research interests lie in Cryptography and its intersection with Formal Methods, particularly in the formal verification of cryptographic algorithms.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Porto University](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en/web_base.gera_pagina?p_pagina=home). In my thesis, entitled "[Integrated Verification of Cryptographic Security Proofs and Implementations](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/127089)", I addressed the gap between provable security and cryptographic practice when applied to the particular scenario of multiparty computation (MPC), contributing with new mechanically verified proofs of cryptographic protocols and also with new techniques that interpolate between cryptographic security and foundational programming languages concepts such as non-interference.

My main research contributions consist of the development of mechanically verified cryptographic proofs using the [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt) framework, a deductive verification tool focused on Cryptography reasoning. I have participated in many projects involving the application of Formal Methods to the development of cryptographic software, ranging from the development of verified implementations of MPC protocols to the formalization and proof of the AWS Key Management System.
