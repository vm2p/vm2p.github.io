**Abstract:** This repository contains the source-code of the ALICE platform. 

The key features of ALICE are: i. automatically detecting and extracting implementations of weak or broken cryptographic primitives from binaries without requiring source code or debugging symbols; ii. identifying the context and scope in which such primitives are used, and performing program analysis to determine the effects of replacing such implementations with more secure ones; and iii. replacing implementations of weak primitives with those of stronger or more secure ones.
