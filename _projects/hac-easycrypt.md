**Abstract:** This repository contains work focusing on computer-aided verification and automated synthesis of high-assurance cryptographic protocols and algorithms using the EasyCrypt toolset.

The repository includes:
- EasyCrypt formalization of two MPC-in-the-Head implementations 
- EasyCrypt formalization of the Line-Point Zero Knowledge (LPZK) protocol
- OCaml MPC-in-the-Head verified implementation
- OCaml LPZK verified implementation
