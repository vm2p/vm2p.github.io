**Abstract:** This repository contains the EasyCrypt to OCaml extraction tool, focused on the functional core of EasyCrypt. It takes as input an EasyCrypt script and produces a WhyML file that matches the EasyCrypt file (and appropriate dependencies). Finally, it is possible to obtain verified OCaml code by relying on Why3 own extraction mechanism.
